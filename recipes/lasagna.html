    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce
        and a deliciously cheesy filing. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls
        for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
